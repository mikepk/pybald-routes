  <p>Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for
  mapping URLs to application actions, and conversely to generate URLs. Routes makes it easy to
create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful with little effort.</p>
  
  <p>Current features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Named Routes</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Sophisticated Route lookup</strong> and URL generation</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Wildcard paths</strong> before and after static parts</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Sub-domain support</strong> is built-in</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional matching</strong> based on domain, cookies, HTTP method (RESTful) and more</li>
    <li><strong>Redirect routes</strong>: Routes can handle redirects itself
    without bothering the application</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Easily extensible</strong> using custom condition functions and route generation functions</li>
    <li><strong>Extensive unit tests</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Buzzword Compliance: <em>REST</em>, <em>DRY</em>

  <h2>New features in Routes 1.10</h2>

    <h4>URLGenerator object</h4>
    <p>The URLGenerator provides a more extensible way to generate URLs
    compared to <code>url_for()</code>.  It's the technology behind the
    <code>url</code> object in Pylons.

    <h4>Redirect routes</h4>
    <p>You can now put redirects directly into the route map, avoiding the need
    to create stub actions in your application code.</p>

    <h4>Path variables in static routes</h4>
    <p>Static routes can now interpolate variables just like regular
    routes.</p>

  
  <h2>New features in Routes 1.9</h2>

    <h4>Minmization is optional</h4>
    <p>Pylons 0.9.7 will default to turning minimization off (projects are free to leave it on if desired). This means that constructing a route like this with minimization off:</p>

    <p><tt>map.connect('/:controller/:action/')</tt></p>

    <p>will actually require both the controller and the action to be present, and the trailing slash. This addresses the trailing slash issue I wanted to fix as well.</p>
    <h4>Named Routes will always use the route named</h4>
    <p>This is now on by default in Routes 1.9, which results in faster url_for calls as well as the predictability that comes with knowing exactly which route will be used.</p>

    <h4>Optional non-Railsâ€™ish syntax</h4>
    <p>You can now specify route paths in the same syntax that Routes 2 will be using:</p>

    <p><tt>map.connect('/{controller}/{action}/{id}')</tt></p>
    
    <p>Or if you wanted to include the requirement that the id should be 2 digits:</p>
    <p><tt>map.connect('/{controller}/{action}/{id:\d\d}')</tt></p>
    <p>Routes automatically builds the appropriate regular expression for you, keeping your routes a lot
easier to skim over than a bunch of regular expressions.</p>
    <p>Routes 2 will be bringing redirect routes, and generation-only routes, making Routes 1.9 a great way to transition to Routes 2 when its ready.</p>
